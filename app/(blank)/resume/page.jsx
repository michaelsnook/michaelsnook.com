            <p>
              I&rsquo;ve spent the last 10 years managing tech for campaigners –
              from elections, to advocacy, to facilitating collaborations across
              five continents, building the core tech that powers a campaigning
              organisation. Now I&rsquo;m looking to get back to my roots:
              organising, outreach, putting my skills and experience to work on
              a job in tech management, product, and digital campaigning
              solutions to directly support the campaigners and activists
              working to change the world.

              At OPEN I facilitated the network&rsquo;s tech teams to learn,
              share and collaborate across 19 countries, languages and political
              contexts, hosting events and facilitating community development of
              their core organizing tech to supercharge innovation and

                Community management: I made sure every one of the
                network&rsquo;s 60 tech staff knew who everyone else was, what
                resources were available to them, who to go to for advice on
                whatever topic comes to mind, and often facilitated those
                conversations.

                the partners to agree to capacity-adjusted commitments of staff
                time and money, and making sure they were happy with the product
                we&apos;d set out to build together.

              As employee #1 at the PCCC, I got to help the organisation grow
              from a scrappy, 5-person operation to a national powerhouse with a
              team of 35, while I grew from a data manager to the head of a team
              of six developers, designers and analysts supporting a nimble,
              ambitious, wide-ranging advocacy program.

              As the first and last member of the team, I ended up doing a
              little bit of everything, but my core focus was on the field
              program: using the voter file, polling and demographic data to set
              target voters, precincts, to plan and budget our outreach. I also
              wrote a lot of emails, snail-mail, some candidate speeches. We won
              the race by 727 votes in deep rural Virginia with a message well
              to the left of the district.
